# This file provides functions to perform the demodulation of the
#  telescopes' .dat files.
# The important functions here are:
#  demodulate(data): demodulates the given data (assumed to be in the
#    format read from the telescopes' .dat files).
#  demodulate_dat(filename): reads the data in the given .dat file and
#    demodulates it into an array of data type demod_dtype.
#
# Here is a lengthy explanation of what the demodulation process is and
#  why we do it that way:
# Okay. So, we have this thing called a half-wave plate, which is a metal
#  plate with a bunch of parallel wires across the front. Its effect is
#  this: light comes in. Part of it is unpolarized, and that is reflected
#  off the plate normally. Part of it is completely polarized, and the
#  direction of polarization is mirrored around the plane (a) perpendicular
#  to the disk and (b) including the wire where the light is hitting.
# Because of how mirroring works, this means that the direction of the
#  polarization we're measuring rotates twice for every time the half-wave
#  plate rotates. On top of that, since light polarized "leftwards"
#  is the same as light polarized "rightwards", we get four cycles of
#  up-down-ness to left-right-ness.
# Now, from that information, we want to calculate two numbers, Q and U.
#  Q is (vertical polarization) minus (horizontal polarization),
#  so in one revolution it goes (high,low,high,low,high,low,high,low):
#  one (high,low) for each time the measured polarization direction
#  goes from vertical to horizontal.
#  U is (up-rightish polarization) minus (down-rightish polarization),
#  so it's KIND OF like Q phase-shifted forward by half a (high,low)
#  transition.
# Now, to calculate the Q and U of the light BEFORE it gets weirded up
#  by the half-wave plate, we multiply Q by a [+1,-1] square wave to
#  approximately fix the rotation that the half-wave plate puts on,
#  the square wave having the period of the (high,low) transitions.
#  The square wave for U is the same as for Q, just phase-shifted by
#  half a hump.
# We take the mean of (data * square wave) to approximate the Q and U.
#  We also want to find T, intensity, but that's easy: just the mean
#  value of the data channel over the revolution.
#
# So! In total, what we do is this:
#  Read revolutions from a .dat file.
#  Make two copies of each channel's data.
#  Multiply each copy by a square wave.
#  Average the multiplied value over each revolution (and average the
#    unmultiplied original value).
#  Return an array 49 elements wide:
#    (revolution number + mean TQU of each channel) for each revolution.
